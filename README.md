Books4All is a front-end web development project that represents an online book store designed specifically for students and book readers. The website is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, focusing on clean design and ease of navigation. It features a visually appealing homepage with promotional banners, featured books, discount pricing, and call-to-action buttons such as Add to Cart. The project demonstrates essential web development concepts including responsive layout, reusable components, and basic user interaction. Although it does not include backend functionality or real payment processing, Books4All serves as a strong foundation for understanding how modern e-commerce websites are designed and can be extended in the future with database integration, user authentication, and payment gateways.
